Packaged to also be used in a node environment. \n\nThis library is a packaging of the original code from Tom Wu. The original files are available in the\noriginal/ folder or on his [site](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nIf you are using npm (the node packet manager), installing is as easy as:\n    npm install bignumber\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor help on using this in node.js, have a look at the tests. Here is a simple example on\nhow to generate a new key and use it to encrypt/decrypt a message.\n\n    var rsa = require(\"bigint\");\n    var key = new rsa.Key();\n\n    var message = \"All your bases are belong to us.\";\n    console.log(\"Message:\\n\"+message+\"\\n\");\n\n    // Generate a key\n    key.generate(1024, \"10001\");\n    console.log(\"Key:\\n\");\n    console.log(\"n:\" + key.n.toString(16));\n    console.log(\"e:\" + key.e.toString(16));\n    console.log(\"d:\" + key.d.toString(16));\n    console.log(\"\\n\");\n\n    // Encrypt\n    var encrypted = key.encrypt(message);\n    console.log(\"Encrypted:\\n\" + rsa.linebrk(encrypted, 64) + \"\\n\" );\n\n    // Decrypt\n    var decrypted = key.decrypt(encrypted);\n    console.log(\"Decrypted:\" + rsa.linebrk(decrypted, 64) + \"\\n\");\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe original documentation is available at <http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/>.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2003-2005  Tom Wu\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS-IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, \nEXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY \nWARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  \n\nIN NO EVENT SHALL TOM WU BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,\nINDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER\nRESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE, AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT\nOF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.\n\nIn addition, the following condition applies:\n\nAll redistributions must retain an intact copy of this copyright notice\nand disclaimer.\n",
